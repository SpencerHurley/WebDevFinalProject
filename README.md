Hi! This is the repo for the front-end of my most recent personal project. I made a running website, RunSmart, that lets users log runs, join teams, set weekly goals, search for routes in their area, and star other peoples' runs. Feel free to check it out! It's hosted on a free heroku server at the moment so it loads slowly, and then the server is also hosted for free on Heroku, so that takes a few seconds to warm up as well. More changes planned for fall 2018, so stay tuned.
